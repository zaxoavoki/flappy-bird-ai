# Flappy Bird clone with AI

Flappy Bird clone game with AI. The game generates initially 10 birds and then predicts two values - probabilities (**jump** or **not**).

I have used Tensorflow.js for making neural network with 4 inputs, 4 nodes in hidden layer and layer with 2 output nodes.

## Try it

 1. Clone or download this repo
 2. Install Node.js 10+
 3. Change `config.js` to match your preferences
 4. Build bundle with `npm run dev` or `npm run prod`
 5. Open `index.html` and train your model.

## To-do

 - [ ] Improve genetic algorithm (get two best parents)
 - [ ] Add textures for pipes and bird
 - [ ] Add animations for birds
