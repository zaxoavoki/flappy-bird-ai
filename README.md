# Flappy Bird clone with AI

Flappy Bird clone game with AI. The game generates initially 10 birds and then predicts two values - probabilities **jump** or **not**.

I have used Tensorflow.js for making neural network with 4 inputs, 4 nodes in hidden layer and layer with 2 output nodes.

## To-do

 - [ ] Save trained model and load on game start
 - [ ] Improve genetic algorithm (get two best parents)
 - [ ] Add textures for pipes and bird
 - [ ] Add animations for bird
